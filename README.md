I've been sitting on this old resume template for a while now, so I might as well open source it.

It uses Myriad and Proxima Nova fonts, which aren't CC so I can't redistribute them. If you have access to them, set them up as needed. If not, just redefine the fonts ini `style_red.css`

To customize colours, your logo, or fonts, you can just tweak the values in `style_red.css`, without having to dive into the mess that is `rulez.css`
