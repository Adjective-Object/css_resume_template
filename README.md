# Simple HTML/SCSS Resume Template

I've been sitting on this old resume template for a while now, so I might as well open source it.

It uses Myriad and Proxima Nova fonts, which aren't CC so I can't redistribute them.

If you have access to them, set them up as needed. If not, just redefine the fonts ini `style_red.css`
